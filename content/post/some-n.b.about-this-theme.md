As you may have noticed this website lacks some functionality

<!--more-->

This is because AMP is like developing and maintaining a separate website. For now I will focus on the main website and in future when the main site is stable and complete enough I will try to move some stuff to the AMP version too. Hopefully Hugo will fix some bugs (like the [#7160](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/7160), they have delayed the development of the theme and that causes problems in the RSS too).

You may have noticed that the original theme has multilingual support but this version doesn't. I plan to implement it in the future.

I also plan to implement metadata stripping from media files and maybe resize/compression too when Hugo starts having a better documentation for this stuff.
