Tutorial on how to setup your blog to use this theme

## Netlify

### Initial setup

You can deploy a blog automatically by using the automatic setup by [clicking here.](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IcpMoles/pyxback&stack=hugo)

Once signed up or logged in Netlify, linked your GitHub or GitLab account, you're going to be asked a name for the repository where Netlify will save your configuration files and all the posts' archive. Choose a name and keep in mind that this repository can be hidden later on.
